# New Apple

With a partner, discuss the layout provided below (screenshot are a modified version of the smallest viewport layout on the [Apple Canada Homepage](https://www.apple.com/ca/)) and consider what elements will be required to create the content.

Recreate the layout below using HTML and CSS. **NOTE**: A few of the Apple source images in the folder are slightly different than what's shown below, this is for an upcoming example. Simply create the closest approximation.

# Layout Screenshots

There are _three_ screenshots below, **please review all three before starting.**

The layout with the menu open:

![Apple's Mobile Layout](img/sample-layout-open-menu.png?raw=true "Apple's Mobile Layout")

When the menu is closed, the layout will look like this:

![Apple's Mobile w/ Closed Menu](img/sample-layout.png?raw=true "Apple's Mobile w/ Closed Menu")

This is the menu in isolation (same as in the first image):

![The Menu](img/sample-layout-menu.png?raw=true "The Menu")
